# Parallel Jacobi

A parallel implementation of the Jacobi algorithm for determining the solutions of a strictly diagonally dominant system of linear equations.


## Implementation

The parallel version of this algorithm has been implemented as below:

1. The row vectors of the matrix are equally distributed among the workers.
2. Each process start to compute the sub-result assigned.
3. As the computation of all the workers is ended, the sub-results are collected and joined in a support vector.
4. Repeat since step 1 until convergence.

To speedup the process everythink is done directly inside the instance of the Class Linear System.

Everything has been implemented in three different ways:
- Sequential version, for comparison.
- Thread parallel version, using a barrier as a synchronization point.
- Fastflow version, using the optimized ParallelFor in [fastflow](https://github.com/fastflow/fastflow).

## Compiling and running

To compile the program, simply launch from the base directory

```bash
make all
```

Three executable will be created in the build folder, respectively for the sequential, parallel thread and parallel fastflow version.

To run the builds, launch from the base directory

```bash
./build/executable dim iters nw check[0/1]
``` 

where

- **dim**: Shape of the square matrix and of the vectors.
- **iters**: Number of cycle to iterate the Jacobi method.
- **nw**: stands for the maximum parallelism degree to be used. Do not specify this if you are running the sequential version.
- **check**: Boolean for testing puposes: [0] => false, the system will not be shown; [1] => true, the system will be printed.

Instead to run the experiments scripts run

```bash 
bash ./experiments/[amdahl || gustafsson || average].sh
```

## Results

Below are some results of the speedup achieved on a XEON Phi machine, hosting 32 physical cores with 4-way hyperthreading. Hence the maximum **nw** was set to 128 threads.  
The first plot compare the sequential code with ff and std parallel implementations with a matrix of shape(2560, 2560) insted in the second shape(5120, 5120).
